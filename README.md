# Fish Tank

A simple pixelated fish tank to run like a screensaver or just to watch nemo and dory swim around.

I wanted something like this -extremely simple- but couldn't find just what I wanted, so I built it.

## Instructions:
Download and extract the zip of the code, then run `make` to compile everything together. 

Then run the executable with `./fishtank`
